                    <p>
                    <h3>Greetings! I'm Mehdi</h3>
                    <h5>Photographer, Green Activist, and in love with visual culture of my vicinity!</h5>
                    </p>

                    <p>I was raised in Isfahan, a city which is often considered as the cultural capital of Iran. Soon
                        in my early
                        childhood, my family found out about my passion for visual arts where they would always find me
                        binge
                        watching the TV commercials, or gazing at the advertisement billboards all across the city.
                        After a
                        while, they encouraged me to get more involved with my passion and start learning drawing skills
                        in a
                        local drawing class. Later on during my teenagehood, I became obsessed with blending realism to
                        my
                        imaginative ideas, and that was where I was drawn to the art of Photography. I spent so much
                        time
                        throughout my high school, looking for the most breathtaking landscapes in the environment I was
                        living in at the time, so I could capture that scene through the lenses of my camera.</p>
                    <p>
                        To revive my passion for visual arts in an academic setting, I decided to pursue a Masters of
                        Fine Arts in Photography at Soore University. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soore_University" target="_blank">Soore University</a>  is one of the best academic
                        centers which is solely focused on art majors. Soon I became one of the Soore’s Photographers’
                        Society member, through which I met other artists and we ran some collaborative art projects
                        together. These projects were mostly concentrated on the iranian contemporary visual culture and
                        visual anthropology of middle east.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The idea behind these projects became an starting point for my thesis. I decided to research
                        about cultural diffusion and iranian photography, specifically on Instagram platform, which is
                        the dominant content sharing platform between the Iranian people. The research claims that the
                        representation of spatial diffusion or cultural diffusion in the contemporary visual culture of
                        Iran is highly conspicuous. By doing content analysis on Iranian Instagram photographs, this
                        report tries to inspect the spatial diffusion of innovations theory developed by the notable
                        Swedish geographer Torsten Hägerstrand about several visual elements in Iranian photos shared
                        in Instagram as the most popular social media in this country. The visual data in this work
                        collected over 44000 photographs from 90 cities in a five-year period (2015-2019). I managed to
                        finish my MFA studies with straight A’s and considerable praise from the academic faculty for my
                        thesis as a work which “shed new beams of light on contemporary visual culture of Iran”.

                        Iran is geographically divided into 13 different cultural areas according to ethnics, languages,
                        and religion in this research work. This report identifies the list of visual concepts for
                        classifying photos collected from various cities in these areas. After tagging and categorizing
                        pictures in the content analysis process, several new patio-temporal data, pie charts, and heat
                        maps were achieved.

                        essential patterns, hierarchical and contagious, among numbers of cities and areas was detected.

                        In conclusion, this work recognizes that some big cities like Tehran and Tabriz originate some
                        innovations hierarchically distributed to other smaller towns. For instance, existing women
                        without Islamic hijab or cats visual elements in Instagram photos are recognized as these some
                        innovations. Also, this work found some contagious diffusion paths among some areas, such as the
                        distribution of motorcycle visual objects from the Kurdistan area to its adjacent cultural
                        areas.
