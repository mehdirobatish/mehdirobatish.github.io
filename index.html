                <section id="about">
                    <p>Greetings! I am Mohammad Robati Shirzad and I am currently
                        an ECE MASc student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>I was born in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar-e_Mahshahr" target="_blank">small
                            city</a> in the southwest of Iran. The city is famous for hosting a massive
                        petroleum reservoir, and there was a refinery factory, built close to the city, where my father
                        worked as a civil engineer. Growing up in a city with numerous large factories brought up the
                        question for me, “ How large-scale systems are built ? ”.</p>
                    <p>I grew up with the dream of building massive systems that involve so many people to build and
                        maintain them. Despite the fact that the people living in my city back then usually pursued a
                        profession related to extracting oil, I was more interested in technology and computer systems.
                        During high school, I was introduced to computer engineering as a subject to study at
                        university. My goal first was to get a B.S. in computer engineering and gain the required
                        knowledge and skills to make a difference in the tech area and build systems that will benefit
                        so many people.</p>
                    <p>I got ranked in the top 0.5% in Iran's National University Entrance Exam, and I am currently in
                        the beginning of the 8th semester at AUT studying Computer Engineering. My current GPA is 18.23/20 and I have
                        managed to pass all courses in the last 5 semesters with straight A's</p>
                    <p>After I entered university, I started to learn all kinds of skills related to making better
                        computer softwares. With the coding experience in many different languages, I achieved the 3rd
                        rank among more than one thousand participants in the <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://quera.ir/contest/assignments/14060/scoreboard/">SnappTrip programming
                            contest</a>, which assessed both algorithmic thinking and interface design capabilities
                        during the contest. </p>
                    <p>After my undergraduate studies, I decided to pursue a research career in Software Engineering abroad
                        to acquire knowledge in the newest and the most up-to-date methods and tools in Software Engineering and be able to 
                        manage a robust and reliable large-scale software system.</p>
                    <p>I was very fortunate to be accepted in a two-year master's program at the University of Waterloo as it is one of the top
                        25 universities for Computer Engineering in the whole world. My research is under the supervision of 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patricklam.ca/">Dr. Patrick Lam</a> 
                        and on the subject of program analysis and verification.</p>
